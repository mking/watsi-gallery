She enjoys listening to Khmer pop songs.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSreyneang is 23 years old, and was sent by a neighbor to get help from CSC. “Sreyneang has had a very stiff right knee for most of her life, a result of receiving improper injections from a very young age into her quadriceps,” CSC reports. “She has serious trouble fully extending her leg.” It is also very painful for Sreyneang to walk more than a short distance.\r\n\r\nWith $378 in funding, Sreyneang will receive a quadriceplasty—a corrective surgical procedure on the quadriceps muscle and tendon that releases adhesions and improves mobility. The funding will also cover medication, post-operative care, food, and a 10-day hospital stay for Sreyneang.\r\n\r\nFollowing surgery, CSC explains, “Sreyneang will have more mobility in her leg and will not feel pain after walking short distances.” Let’s help Sreyneang get the care she needs to live without pain.","age":23,"country":"Cambodia","url":"https://watsi.org/profile/c391b5a5b6da-sreyneang","badge_url":"https://d3w52z135jkm97.cloudfront.net/uploads/profile/image/4864/badge_Mon-37642.pre_op_16.july_15.jpg","profile_url":"https://d3w52z135jkm97.cloudfront.net/uploads/profile/image/4864/profile_Mon-37642.pre_op_16.july_15.jpg","per_cent_funded":"10%","target":"$378","target_to_go":"$338 to go","donated":"$40","number_of_donors":3}
