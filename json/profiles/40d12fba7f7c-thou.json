Thou has lived with a cataract in her left eye for 20 years. “She has had a very hard time doing work at the farm and going to the pagoda,” explains our medical partner, Children's Surgical Centre (CSC).\r\n\r\nFor just $150, we can give Thou surgery that will remove her cataract and restore her vision, as doctors will replace her clouded lens with an artificial one. After her vision is restored, CSC shares, “Thou is looking forward to not having pain, returning to work at the farm and going to the pagoda with more ease.”\r\n\r\nLet’s help ease Thou’s pain and allow her to see normally again.","age":66,"country":"Cambodia","url":"https://watsi.org/profile/40d12fba7f7c-thou","badge_url":"https://d3w52z135jkm97.cloudfront.net/uploads/profile/image/4850/badge_Pre-Op_15-5604.JPG","profile_url":"https://d3w52z135jkm97.cloudfront.net/uploads/profile/image/4850/profile_Pre-Op_15-5604.JPG","per_cent_funded":"0%","target":"$150","target_to_go":"$150 to go","donated":"$0","number_of_donors":0}
