Cataracts can develop with old age, and if left untreated, can lead to decreased vision and blindness as the lens inside the eye becomes cloudy. While as much as 90% of blindness could be avoided in Cambodia with proper treatment, barriers such as cost limit availability of this treatment.\r\n\r\nFor $150 we can enable Hen to get cataract surgery on his right eye. “Hen will have restored vision,” CSC continues. “After surgery Hen wants to plant crops around his house, help his wife clean the house, and most of all he wants to stop bothering her when he needs help.” \r\n","age":52,"country":"Cambodia","url":"https://watsi.org/profile/46af728f8a15-hen","badge_url":"https://d3w52z135jkm97.cloudfront.net/uploads/profile/image/4868/badge_Pre-Op_15-6925.JPG","profile_url":"https://d3w52z135jkm97.cloudfront.net/uploads/profile/image/4868/profile_Pre-Op_15-6925.JPG","per_cent_funded":"13%","target":"$150","target_to_go":"$130 to go","donated":"$20","number_of_donors":2}
