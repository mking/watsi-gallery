To earn a living, Ratanak sells clothes at the market, and he enjoys watching soccer on television and playing baseball in his free time.\r\n\r\nOur medical partner, Children’s Surgical Centre (CSC), tells us, “Ratanak has a pterygium in his right eye that is very uncomfortable and makes it difficult to do his job and watch TV.”\r\n\r\nA pterygium is a triangular growth of tissue in the eye that extends from the inner or outer corner of the eye toward the center. The tissue appears as a thin or thick, white or pink membrane on the surface of the eye. It often is not noticeable until it begins to cover the iris—the colored portion of the eye. A person with a pterygium may experience eye redness and discomfort and blurry vision.\r\n\r\nThe recommended treatment for Ratanak is surgical removal of the pterygium. $150 covers the cost of surgery, medication, and post-operative follow-up care. After surgery, CSC says that Ratanak “will no longer have burning sensations in his eye.”\r\n\r\nRatanak looks forward to feeling better and returning to work. Let’s help make it happen!","age":29,"country":"Cambodia","url":"https://watsi.org/profile/111b33093a1e-ratanak","badge_url":"https://d3w52z135jkm97.cloudfront.net/uploads/profile/image/4870/badge_Pre-Op_15-5485.jpg","profile_url":"https://d3w52z135jkm97.cloudfront.net/uploads/profile/image/4870/profile_Pre-Op_15-5485.jpg","per_cent_funded":"6%","target":"$150","target_to_go":"$140 to go","donated":"$10","number_of_donors":1}
