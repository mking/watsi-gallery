A cataract is a condition in which there is progressive clouding of the internal lens in the eye. “She has difficulty seeing faces and can’t go anywhere on her own, “ CSC explains. “Her husband can’t do his work well because he constantly has to attend to her.”\r\n\r\n$225 will fund the treatment Pov needs to correct her vision. With this funding, Pov will receive cataract surgery—a procedure in which the cloudy lens is removed from her eye and replaced it with a clear lens implant. Without this procedure, Pov is at risk for permanent blindness.\r\n\r\nAfter her recovery, Pov’s vision will be clear and her independence restored.\r\n\r\nCSC shares, “Pov is excited to see clearly again, help her husband in the farm, and take care of her grandchildren.","age":53,"country":"Cambodia","url":"https://watsi.org/profile/523aabc4f309-pov","badge_url":"https://d3w52z135jkm97.cloudfront.net/uploads/profile/image/4852/badge_Pre-Op_15-6855.JPG","profile_url":"https://d3w52z135jkm97.cloudfront.net/uploads/profile/image/4852/profile_Pre-Op_15-6855.JPG","per_cent_funded":"15%","target":"$225","target_to_go":"$190 to go","donated":"$35","number_of_donors":2}
