For the last four years, Lim has lived with worsening blurry vision caused by these cataracts. He is no longer able to work in his fields or go anywhere on his own.\r\n\r\nWith $225 in funding, Lim will receive surgery to remove these cataracts, replacing his original lenses with artificial ones. Following surgery, Lim should have clear vision in both eyes, giving him the freedom to work and relax independently.\r\n\r\nCSC shares, “After surgery, Lim plans to go back and plant crops on the farm and go places on his own.”","age":67,"country":"Cambodia","url":"https://watsi.org/profile/d2e0fc69fb4e-lim","badge_url":"https://d3w52z135jkm97.cloudfront.net/uploads/profile/image/4865/badge_Pre-Op_15-6892.JPG","profile_url":"https://d3w52z135jkm97.cloudfront.net/uploads/profile/image/4865/profile_Pre-Op_15-6892.JPG","per_cent_funded":"8%","target":"$225","target_to_go":"$205 to go","donated":"$20","number_of_donors":2}
