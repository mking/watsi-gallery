Unfortunately, her blurred vision makes these activities much more difficult.\r\n\r\nWith $225, we can fund the removal of San’s cataracts, along with post-operative care and medication. Doctors will replace San’s current, cloudy lenses with artificial ones. This will allow San to regain her vision and see properly. \r\n\r\nAccording to CSC, “After surgery, San looks forward to eating and walking without issue, going to the pagoda alone, sewing, and not bothering members of her family.” ","age":80,"country":"Cambodia","url":"https://watsi.org/profile/8d79fc337c1d-san","badge_url":"https://d3w52z135jkm97.cloudfront.net/uploads/profile/image/4867/badge_Pre-Op_15-6927.JPG","profile_url":"https://d3w52z135jkm97.cloudfront.net/uploads/profile/image/4867/profile_Pre-Op_15-6927.JPG","per_cent_funded":"8%","target":"$225","target_to_go":"$205 to go","donated":"$20","number_of_donors":2}
