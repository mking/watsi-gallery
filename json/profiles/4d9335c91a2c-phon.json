She is a mother to one son, and grandmother to his two children. Phon enjoys doing housework and listening to the monks pray.\r\n\r\nOur medical partner, Children’s Surgical Center (CSC), tells us, “Phon has had a painful pterygium in her right eye for 20 years,” a condition that causes discomfort as a result of a benign growth on her cornea. As a result of the growth, she experiences burning sensations in her eye, blurred vision, and redness and puffiness.\r\n\r\nBy funding a simple treatment, we can help relieve Phon of the discomfort she has experienced as a result of her pterygium. For $150, she will receive surgery to remove the growth and she will no longer experience the burning sensation in her eye.\r\n\r\n“After surgery, she is looking forward to having a more comfortable life and wants to go visit her son in a different province,” shares CSC. Let’s support Phon in finding relief for her condition.","age":70,"country":"Cambodia","url":"https://watsi.org/profile/4d9335c91a2c-phon","badge_url":"https://d3w52z135jkm97.cloudfront.net/uploads/profile/image/4873/badge_Pre-Op_15-6896.JPG","profile_url":"https://d3w52z135jkm97.cloudfront.net/uploads/profile/image/4873/profile_Pre-Op_15-6896.JPG","per_cent_funded":"13%","target":"$150","target_to_go":"$130 to go","donated":"$20","number_of_donors":2}
