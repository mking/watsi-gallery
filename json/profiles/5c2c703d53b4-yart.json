She enjoys reading Khmer romance novels, listening to the radio, going to the pagoda, and taking care of her grandchildren.\r\n\r\n“Yart has been living with cataracts for two years,” reports our medical partner, Children’s Surgical Centre (CSC). “They make it very hard for her to walk to the pagoda or anywhere by herself.”\r\n\r\nYart’s cataracts are the result of age-related changes in the lenses of her eyes. The lens—which focuses light—becomes opaque, or cloudy. This leads to blurry or dull vision and increased nearsightedness, making it difficult to perform daily activities. Cataract formation typically occurs in both eyes, as Yart is experiencing.\r\n\r\nWith $225 in funding, Yart will undergo surgery to remove the cloudy lenses from her eyes and replace them with artificial lenses. Funding for Yart’s treatment also includes medication and post-operative follow-up care.\r\n\r\nCSC explains that, after surgery, “Yart will have restored vision in her eyes.”\r\n\r\nYart looks forward to regaining some of her independence after removal of the cataracts.
