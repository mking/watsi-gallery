Our medical partner, Children’s Surgical Centre (CSC), tells us, “Yart is married with a daughter and four grandchildren. She enjoys watching Thai dramas in the afternoon.”\r\n\r\nThis hobby is made more difficult by Yart’s cataracts—marked by clouding of the normally clear lenses of the eyes. “She is really worried that she will go blind because her vision is so bad,” CSC explains. “Yart cannot work at the farm and has trouble going anywhere by herself.”\r\n\r\nWith $225 in funding, Yart will receive surgery to replace her current lenses with artificial ones. This procedure will restore her vision and make her life more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nCSC shares, “After surgery, Yart looks forward to going back and working on the farm, baking Khmer cakes, taking care of her grandchildren and regaining some of her independence.”","age":67,"country":"Cambodia","url":"https://watsi.org/profile/71a410d0a7a1-yart","badge_url":"https://d3w52z135jkm97.cloudfront.net/uploads/profile/image/4866/badge_Pre-Op_15-6689.JPG","profile_url":"https://d3w52z135jkm97.cloudfront.net/uploads/profile/image/4866/profile_Pre-Op_15-6689.JPG","per_cent_funded":"37%","target":"$225","target_to_go":"$140 to go","donated":"$85","number_of_donors":7}
