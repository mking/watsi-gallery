This is a common condition among elderly people. Everyday life and tasks have become very difficult, and Ho says, “he is sad because he can’t see the faces of his grandchildren.”\r\n\r\nHo needs cataract surgery on both of his eyes to remove the cloudy lenses and replace them with clear implants. This procedure costs $225 for both eyes and CSC reports,“the patient will have better vision from his right eye and he is a candidate for surgery on his left eye in one to two weeks.”\r\n\r\n“After surgery Ho looks forward to going to pagoda [Hindu or Buddhist temple], helping his daughter do work at home, feeding his cows, and playing with his grandchildren,” CSC says.
